I refer to Selenium2Library Doc: http://robotframework.org/Selenium2Library/Selenium2Library.html#Element%20Should%20Contain
This is the first time I use robotframework, it is awesome.
Record:
11-22-2018 I met a problem when I want a string between div, however, I can't get the string when I locate this div.
SOLVED: this is div may be hided, so I located the father div and it works.
